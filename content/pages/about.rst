What is the GD library?
-----------------------

GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images
by programmers. GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are available for
Perl, PHP and other languages. GD creates PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, XPM, BMP
images, among other formats. GD is commonly used to generate charts, 
graphics, thumbnails, and most anything else, on the fly. While not 
restricted to use on the web, the most common applications of GD involve
website development.

The library was originally developed by `Thomas Boutell`_ and is now
maintained by `Pierre Joye`_ under the umbrella of `PHP.net`_.
